# Nintendo-Games-Analysis
This project attempts to predict what the highest selling game Nintendo could have released during the 2010s, and whether North America’s and Japan’s tastes differ in this hypothetical game.

This is a final project pulled from an Intro to Data Analysis class. In it, I was given a choice of four data sets to dig into. From there, free reign was given as to what question to ask, methods to analyze, and visuals to display.
