# Nintendo-Games-Analysis
This project attempts to predict what the highest selling game Nintendo could have released during the 2010s based on genre, platform, and franchise. It also determines whether North America’s and Japan’s tastes differ in this hypothetical game.

This is a final project pulled from an Intro to Data Analysis class. In it, I was given a choice of four data sets to dig into using RStudio. From there, free reign was given as to what question to ask, methods to analyze, and visuals to display.

The files in this repo are as follows:
- vgsales.csv: the original downloaded data
- Data 115 Final Project_ Nintendo Game Analysis.pdf: the submitted pdf documenting the entire process including cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling. It also includes where the original data came from, future analysis ideas, and concluding thoughts.
